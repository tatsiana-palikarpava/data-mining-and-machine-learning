You can see 4 files in the folder: p4_ex1_kmall.m, p4_ex1_kmsam.m, most_similar.m
and p4_ex1_segm.m.
Function most_similar that is used in p4_ex1_kmsam.m is located in most_similar.m. 
We added the possibility of segmentation to p4_ex1_kmsam.m and p4_ex1_kmall.m,
but if you don't want to wait until the quantization is performed, you can run
the file p4_ex1_segm.m, where the original image is segmented (Comments to the code
are also located in this file). You should keep in mind, that since the image to be 
segmented in p4_ex1_kmsam.m has significantly less colors than in p4_ex1_segm.m, 
number nc must be completely different for these cases.
