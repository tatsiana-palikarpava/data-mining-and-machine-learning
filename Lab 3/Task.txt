Load the attached file ex04data.mat and have a look.

a) Consider at least k-NN classifiers with values of k up to 40
and obtain and plot curves with resubstitution and cross-validation
errors (and corresponding standard deviations when appropriate).

Plot all error estimates in a unique curve as a function of k.
Add any other error estimate you consider but explain your decisions.

Comment any aspect in the obtained results that you consider worth it.
If you see something extrange in these results try to figure out what is
happening.

b) Select the optimal value of k according the cross-validation estimate
and plot the corresponding averaged ROC curve in a separate figure.
Add any other important error estimate in this curve you consider 
interesting.

Comment any interesing thing you observe in the corresponding curve or in
the added error estimates or in its relation.

Include code, comments and instructions to run your code in appropriate, 
well-identified files and pack them in a unique compressed file and upload it.

In Matlab/PRtools, you can perform cross validation evaluation using the prtools' function crossval:

AvgErr = crossval(Dataset, Classifier, Nfolds, Nrep=1) 
[AvgErr, Stdev] = crossval(Dataset, Classifier, Nfolds, Nrep>1) 

But you can also manipulate intermediate results by obtaining the partition in folds in an index array as:

R  = crossval(Dataset, [], Nfolds, 0)

From R, you can access the i-th fold as  Dataset(R==i,:) and then compute errors or anything by yourself.

In Python/Scikit-learn, you can use cross_val_score to obtain error rates per fold or cross_val_predict to obtain predictions for all input vectors:

error_rates = cross_val_score(predictor, InputFeatures, InputLabels, cv=5)
predictions = cross_val_predict(predictor, InputFeatures, InputLabels, cv=5, method='predict')

To load the data use instead the file ex04plain.mat as follows:
from scipy.io import loadmat
Data  = loadmat('ex04plain.mat')
Adata = Data['Adata']
Alab  = Data['Alab']
