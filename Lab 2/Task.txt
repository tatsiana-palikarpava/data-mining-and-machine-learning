Consider the banana shaped dataset a.k.a. two moons dataset with three different levels of noise as shown in the attached scripts both in python and matlab.

Study how the gaussian linear and quadratic classifiers behave on these datasets. In particular, use ROC curves and imagine that one of the classes is more important than the others.

You can use either python or matlab. Or preferably, both. LinearDiscriminantAnalysis and QuadraticDiscriminantAnalysis correspond to ldc and qdc in prtools. 

Please draw your own conclusions and include them as comments along with your code. Try to send clear and organized code and use graphics to support your conclusions.
